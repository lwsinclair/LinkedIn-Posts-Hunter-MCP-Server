## 📖 Overview

**LinkedIn Posts Hunter MCP** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for automating LinkedIn job post search and management through your AI assistant (Claude Desktop, Cursor, or other MCP-compatible clients).

**Why LinkedIn Posts?** Job opportunities often appear in LinkedIn posts first, before they're posted on traditional job boards. By monitoring LinkedIn posts, you can discover opportunities earlier and get a competitive advantage in your job search.

### How it works:

**1. Authentication & Scraping**
- The MCP server exposes a Playwright-based tool that your AI assistant can invoke to automate browser interactions with LinkedIn
- First-time use requires logging into LinkedIn through a browser window to capture session cookies
- These cookies are **stored locally on your computer** for persistent authentication
- Once authenticated, your AI assistant can call the search tool with keywords (either from your conversation or suggested by the AI) to scrape job posts

**2. Local Data Storage**
- All scraped posts are saved to a **local SQLite database** on your machine
- The database stores post content, metadata (author, dates, engagement metrics), and tracking info (whether you've applied)
- Your data never leaves your computer

**3. Visual Interface**
- A separate tool launches a **React dashboard** that renders the scraped posts from your local database
- **Visualize all your scraped posts** in table or card views with profile images and engagement metrics
- **Track your applications** by marking posts as "applied" or "saved for later" directly in the UI
- **Quick actions** let you filter, sort, and manage posts with point-and-click simplicity
- Changes made in the React app are written to the local database. And changes made through MCP commands are reflected in the UI.

**4. Dual Control**
- You can manage posts through **either** the React UI **or** through MCP tools like `manage_posts` and `viewer_filters`
- The React app updates via **polling**, so changes made through MCP commands are reflected in the UI
- This gives you flexibility: use natural language commands with your AI assistant, or point-and-click in the dashboard
